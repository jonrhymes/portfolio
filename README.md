# GA Capstone Project: Portfolio

Using a basic HTML and Bootstrap CSS, I built a site that links to projects made while completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Remote Fellowship.

It contains the following:
* A list of your current projects (with links to the live sites)
* A resume for download
* Brief bio
* A link to my Github profile
* A link to my LinkedIn account
* Functionality for all screen sizes

It's hosted on Github Pages: [Jonathan Rhymes Portfolio](https://jonrhymes.github.io/portfolio/)
